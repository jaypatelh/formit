          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Motivation: The central purpose of our app is to facilitate the process of creating formations. Thus our user study is going to focus primarily on the base screen (the canvas, list of dancers, list of blocks) and how to make those features most intuitive for the user.</p>
          Goals and Critical Tasks:
          <ul>
            <li>testing adding dancers to the canvas</li>
            <li>testing intuitiveness of assigning blocks</li>
            <li>testing how to delete dancers from a formation</li>
          </ul>
          Driving Questions:
          <ul>
            <li>What is the most intuitive way to add a dancer to a formation?</li>
            <li>Are spots created anonymously and then assigned dancers post-creation?</li>
            <li>Or is it more natural to create a formation already knowing where each specific dancer is going to be?</li>
            <li>What is the most convenient way to assign blocking to groups of dancer within a formation?<li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>Study Design: We describe the purpose of the app but not how to use it. Then we give them instructions and observe how they think the app should be working.</p>
          Tasks:
          <ul>
            <li>Create a v-formation with yourself in the center.</li>
            <li>Now assign blocking to each side of that v-formation.</li>
            <li>Say that a dancer can’t make it to the show, take them out of the formation.</li>
            <li>Create a completely new formation now.</li>
            <li>Assign blocking however you want.</li>
            <li>Make a formation for 15 people.</li>
            <li>Draw out the formations from your most recent set.</li>
          </ul>

      			<li>Switched the position of two dancers in the middle of the timeline, but this change isn’t reflected in later formations which requires more effort because user has to go back and change every successive formation</li>

      			<li>"I would pay for this and use it on a weekly basis."</li>
      			<li>Likes that we did not specify what the colors were for, because he used them to differentiate between genders instead of blocks. He did not even know what blocks were until we told him about them.</li>

      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Would have liked the capability to add a custom path along which the dots can be made to move when transitioning from one formation to another</li>
      			<li>Ability to specify X or O to differentiate between genders, because in Bhangra, everyone does the same steps, so there is no real 'blocking' occuring like it does in hip-hop. The only differences that occur are in steps of guys and girls. So essentially, allowing blocking by symbols rather than just colors.</li>
            <li>Would like the ability to add markers at the bottom of the canvas (horizontally) to mark certain lines</li>

      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Had to count the grid lines to figure out the center horizontal line</li>
      			<li>Dots do not get deselected after their color is set, so after setting a selected dot's color, when he went on to set a different color for another dot, the first dot's color also changed. He got confused until he figured out that there was such a thing as 'deselecting a dot' and that it had to be done manually.</li>

      	<h2>Discussion</h2>
      	<p>After the first few user tests, we began to see trends in what they liked, disliked, and wished for. For example, labeling the dots with names and the ability to have multiple formations proved to be extremely necessary. Other less obvious features we learned about were having a grid to allow for precise placement, having a way to record what the different blocks were actually doing, and having an “offstage” area for dancers not currently dancing. The “delete selected” button actually proved to be more problematic than helpful and confused many users since the changes were only reflected on the canvas and not on the list of dancers. 
			</br>Initially, we allowed users to add dancers by tapping the canvas or adding a name to the list. This ultimately caused more confusion and added complexity to the process, so we now only allow dancers to be added if their name is added to the list of dancers.

      	<h2>Implications</h2>
      	<h4>Features we have already implemented as a result of user-testing:</h4>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Dots labelled with dancer names - now users know exactly who is where at all times</li>
			<li>Multi-select - makes the process of assigning blocking more efficient</li>
      		<li>Save state and multiple formations - expands on the user need, since a given set may have upwards of 20+ formations</li>
      		<li>Snap-to grid - allows users to spend less time on precise placement</li>
      		<li>Automatic de-select - accommodates the users' expectations that after assigning blocking, the dots would de-select</li>
      		<li>Bolded center lines - since most formations are arranged with respect to the center of the stage, indicating where center is makes setting formations easier</li>
      	</ul>
      	<h4>Features added to the pipeline as a result of user-testing:</h4>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Darker shades to indicate “offstage” area - most users ignored the "delete" feature and preferred to drag dancers off to the side when not dancing. That way, they would be able to easily bring the dancer back on stage and be able to keep track of which side of the stage that person was on.</li>
      		<li>Comments/legend for separate blocks - a common complaint was that there was no way to keep track of what each color necessarily meant within each formation</li>
      		<li>Ability to rotate spots with gesture - a common transition used in formation is having dancers rotate spots in a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion. Having this feature would simplify and speed up the process of creating that effect.</li>      		
      		<li>Compact/expand formations with zoom-in/zoom-out gesture - depending on the number of people in a formation and the stage space available, choreographers need to compact or expand the spacing of a set formation</li>
			<li>Ability to draw lines to select a line of dancers within the formation - transitions very often are based on the lines within the formation, whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, therefore allowing users to select lines quickly would speed up the process of creating new formations</li>
