          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Motivation: The central purpose of our app is to facilitate the process of creating formations. Thus our user study is going to focus primarily on the base screen (the canvas, list of dancers, list of blocks) and how to make those features most intuitive for the user.</p>
          Goals and Critical Tasks:
          <ul>
            <li>testing adding dancers to the canvas</li>
            <li>testing intuitiveness of assigning blocks</li>
            <li>testing how to delete dancers from a formation</li>
          </ul>
          Driving Questions:
          <ul>
            <li>What is the most intuitive way to add a dancer to a formation?</li>
            <li>Are spots created anonymously and then assigned dancers post-creation?</li>
            <li>Or is it more natural to create a formation already knowing where each specific dancer is going to be?</li>
            <li>What is the most convenient way to assign blocking to groups of dancer within a formation?<li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>Study Design: We describe the purpose of the app but not how to use it. Then we give them instructions and observe how they think the app should be working.</p>
          Tasks:
          <ul>
            <li>Create a v-formation with yourself in the center.</li>
            <li>Now assign blocking to each side of that v-formation.</li>
            <li>Say that a dancer can’t make it to the show, take them out of the formation.</li>
            <li>Create a completely new formation now.</li>
            <li>Assign blocking however you want.</li>
            <li>Make a formation for 15 people.</li>
            <li>Draw out the formations from your most recent set.</li>
          </ul>

      		<ul>
      			<li>Entering a name automatically created a dot</li>
      			<li>Multi-touch to drag multiple dancers around at once</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Dots weren’t labelled with names so couldn’t distinguish between dancers</li>
      			<li>“I’m going to move the dancers off to the side because I don’t want to delete them and then have to re-add them.”</li>
      			<li>“There should be a grid or something in the background so I don’t spend too much time worrying about lining up the dancers precisely.”</li>
				<li>Wishes he didn’t have to re-draw the formation everytime he wanted a “new one”</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Starting using two hands to assign blocking because there was no multi-select for dancers</li>
      			<li>Accidentally clicked on the wrong color because color blocks were too small</li>
      			<li>“I wanted to just add dots, but then I saw ‘add dancer’ and then just did that instead.”</li>
      		</ul>

      		<h4><b>Phil</b></h4>
      		<p>Likes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Touch aspect to move people around easily</li>
      			<li>Color coordinate different blocking</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>“It would be nice to have labels on these blocks to tell you what they are."</li>
      			<li>"Sometimes I like to know which direction my dancers are facing, whether it’s back, or side, or whatever.”</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>User didn’t know was supposed to press return to add the name to the list</li>
      			<li>“Are they in the same place?” – in reference to when adding multiple dancers, all the dots were put into the canvas on the same spot</li>
      			<li>Tried to align everything perfectly and spent a lot of time doing so</li>
      		</ul>

      		<h4><b>Lloyd</b></h4>
      		<p>Likes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Color-coding the blocks</li>
      			<li>Simplicity of dragging around dancers to move their spots - “super easy”</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>“It would suck if I had a formation of 30 and had to select them all individually to change their color” - since in this version, there was no multi-select</li>
      			<li>Legend on the top that describes the blocking</li>
      			<li>“Say I have a line of 10 people and wanted them to switch lines with another line, if I could just highlight the line, that would be quicker.”</li>
      			<li>A way to somehow keep track of who is offstage and what side they’re on</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>“But I can always put him back… or not.” - in reference to how deleting a dancer from the canvas doesn’t delete the name from the list, which causes lots of confusion</li>
      		</ul>

      		<h4><b>Marcus</b></h4>
      		<p>Likes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Easy to move around</li>
      			<li>Changing colors</li>
      			<li>"This would be even more helpful for the rest of the group."</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Individually doing things (moving dancers and assigning blocks). “There’s probably an easier way, like maybe selecting a bunch.”</li>
      			<li>“Even my sheet of paper is so cryptic that sometimes I won’t even remember what I was talking about” - in reference to not having a key for the different color blocks... needs a way to remember what the colors mean</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>When you have a lot of dancers, the list of block colors gets moved down making it a hassle to keep on scrolling to up and down</li>
      			<li>Tried to delete dancers from list of names instead of from the canvas</li>   		
      		</ul>

      		<h4><b>Sharleen</b></h4>
      		<p>Likes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Assigning the colors and the blocking. It becomes sort of intuitive.</li>
      			<li>Really nice that you can see their names</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Option of having grids - "I naturally like having things exactly where they should be."</li>
      			<li>"Option that if they're holding something (a move), show that they're faded out or something like that."</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Clicked “add one” instead of hitting return to add dancer to canvas</li>
      			<li>Used “delete selected” to try and delete a member off the list of names</li>
      			<li>Thought that if you click on the name of  a person not in formation, that a new dot would show up for their name</li>
      		</ul>
      		
      		<h4><b>Stacy</b></h4>
      		<p>Likes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Colored blocks</li>
      			<li>Going through formations and seeing the traveling</li>
      			<li>Setting formations a lot quicker with a grid bc user is less focused on exact placement</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Wished there was a place to put the dancers if they’re not being used at the moment</li>
      			<li>Disliked putting in dancers one at a time</li>
      			<li>Disliked that you couldn’t delete dancers from the list, only the canvas</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Hesitated to check if dancers were still selected after setting blocking color, as if she was expecting them to automatically de-select</li>
      			<li>“Is there a way to put them back on if they were deleted?”</li>
      			<li>When asked to take someone out of the formation, simply moved a dot to the corner instead of deleting</li>
      		</ul>

      		<h4><b>Lloyd</b></h4>
      		<p><i>Since we have been continously iterating our prototype throughout user testing, we asked Lloyd to test again since this version of the prototype was drastically different from his first user test.</i></p>
      		<p>Likes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>"Ooh, it locks to the grid. That's cool."</li>
      			<li>"Makes me kind of think like, 'Wow, that's what people are seeing.'" - in reference to the dots moving, demonstrating transitions between formations</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Dislikes/Wishes</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>“It’d be cool if there’s a center marker.”</li>
      			<li>Have different icons to indicate facing different directions or holding a different level (i.e. floor, middle, or up)</li>
      			<li>Have more floor space so that lots of dancers could be added or to have formations become even more distinct</li>
      		</ul>
      		<p>Breakdowns</p>
      		<ul>
      			<li>“I think I lost one in the middle.” - because there’s no indication for if the “+” button was pressed, he sometimes forgot or pressed it twice</li>
      			<li>Switched the position of two dancers in the middle of the timeline, but this change isn’t reflected in later formations which requires more effort because user has to go back and change every successive formation</li>
